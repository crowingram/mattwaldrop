						I'm a front-end developer with over a decade of experience building responsive, accessible, and high-performance web interfaces using modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js, along with deep expertise in HTML, CSS/SCSS, and design systems. I specialize in turning complex design concepts into intuitive, scalable user experiencesâ€”collaborating across remote teams to ship clean, maintainable code that meets both business goals and user needs. With a background spanning enterprise CMS platforms, e-commerce, and digital transformation projects, I bring a user-first mindset, strong communication skills, and a passion for continuous learning to every build.
